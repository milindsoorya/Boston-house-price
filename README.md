I used various regression algorithms. Such as:-
- XGBoost
- Random Forest
- Linear Regression
- Support Vector based regression 

## Results
XGBoost algorithm gave the best R-squared Score

     Model	           R-squared Score
XGBoost	                  85.799520
Random Forest	            83.779970
Linear Regression	        71.218184
Support Vector Machines	  59.001585
